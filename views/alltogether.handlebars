        <h4> Makings the get request </h4>
        <p>
                The get request were gone over earlier. In this example we are just going
                to combine the steam profile with the sorting of the most played game.

            <p>In this code example, we start by making the get request to fetch the steam
               profile. What has changed is we now make a request inside of that request
               to fetch that "players" game list. We have abstracted the sorting part into
               its own function for more clarity. Once it is sorted it is able to render
               the new page. Showing the name, profile picture and top 3 games. There is
               a lot more you can do with the api and I suggest you check it out.
